/******************************************************************************

    EVENT MBOX

    The event mechanism is based on a pair of event buffers (buffers "A" and "B") in fixed locations
    in the device's memory. The host processes one buffer (buffer "A") while the other buffer
    (buffer "B") continues to collect events. When the host is finished, it begins processing the
    other buffer ("B") while the first buffer ("A") collects, and so on.
    If the host is not processing events, an interrupt is issued to the host signaling that a
    buffer is ready. The interrupt that the host receives indicates the appropriate event structure
    buffer. Once the host finishes processing events from one buffer,
    it signals with an acknowledge interrupt (bit 0 in the INT_TRIG register) that the event buffer
    is free. This interrupt triggers the device to send the next event structure if there are any
    collected events in it.

    Note: Only one instance (the last) of each type of event is collected.
