This directory contains the original kernel headers that are used to generate Bionic's "cleaned-up" user-land headers.

They are mostly covered by the GPLv2 + exception, and thus cannot be distributed as part of the platform itself.
(NOTE: The cleaned up headers do not contain copyrightable information and are distributed with Bionic)

For more details, please read system/bionic/kernel/README.TXT
