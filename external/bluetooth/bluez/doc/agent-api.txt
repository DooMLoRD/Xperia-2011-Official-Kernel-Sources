Agent hierarchy
===============

Service		unique name
Interface	org.bluez.Agent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release()

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			unregisters the agent. An agent can use it to do
			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
			agent, because when this method gets called it has
			already been unregistered.

		string RequestPinCode(object device)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to get the passkey for an authentication.

			The return value should be a string of 1-16 characters
			length. Longer strings are truncated to 16 characters.
			The string can be alphanumeric.

			Strings starting with '$' are parsed as hex-encoded
			pins. That is, each two following hex characters form
			a single byte of the resulting pin. The parser is
			case-insensitive.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		uint32 RequestPasskey(object device)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to get the passkey for an authentication.

			The return value should be a numeric value
			between 0-999999.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void DisplayPasskey(object device, uint32 passkey, uint8 entered)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to display a passkey for an authentication.

			The entered parameter indicates the number of already
			typed keys on the remote side.

			An empty reply should be returned. When the passkey
			needs no longer to be displayed, the Cancel method
			of the agent will be called.

			During the pairing process this method might be
			called multiple times to update the entered value.

		void RequestConfirmation(object device, uint32 passkey)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to confirm a passkey for an authentication.

			To confirm the value it should return an empty reply
			or an error in case the passkey is invalid.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void RequestPairingConsent(object device)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to confirm an incoming pairing request.

			To accept it should return an empty reply
			or an error to reject.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void Authorize(object device, string uuid)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			needs to authorize a connection/service request.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void ConfirmModeChange(string mode)

			This method gets called if a mode change is requested
			that needs to be confirmed by the user. An example
			would be leaving flight mode.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void Cancel()

			This method gets called to indicate that the agent
			request failed before a reply was returned.
