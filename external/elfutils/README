Fundamental design decision:

- the sizes of external and internal types are assumed to be the same.
  This leaves byte ordering aside.  While assuming this the code can be
  greatly simplified and speed increases.  Since no change violating this
  assumption is in sight this is believed to be a worthwhile optimization.
