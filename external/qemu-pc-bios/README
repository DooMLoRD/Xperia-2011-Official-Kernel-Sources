This project has the source code to build two binaries: bios.bin and
vgabios-cirrus.bin, which are required for x86 emulation in the
Android emulator: platform/external/qemu.


SOURCE CODE

+ bios.bin: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/bochs/bochs.git

  The file bios.bin is actually BIOS-bochs-latest, which is built from
bochs/bios. We used the following commit in the bochs git tree so that
it can match with the qemu tree in platform/external/qemu:

    commit 04387139e3b5ac97b5633cd40b3d87cdf45efd6c
    Author: sshwarts <sshwarts>
    Date:   Mon Feb 9 19:46:34 2009 +0000

        Fixed compilation error + x86-64 correctness fix

  Since our purpose is to build only rombios16.bin, we populated part
of the bochs tree in the git tree above.

+ vgabios-cirrus.bin: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/vgabios/vgabios.git

  The file vgabios-cirrus.bin is VGABIOS-lgpl-latest.cirrus.bin, which
is built by the tree, and we used the following commit.

    commit 33636cbdd93da79c903b91b50ae087bb814b9332
    Author: vruppert <vruppert>
    Date:   Mon Jan 31 17:28:09 2011 +0000

        - added HDTV resolutions (patch by Tristan Schmelcher)

TOOLS REQUIRED TO BUILD

  The build requires dev86 rpm or bin86 & bcc debs version >= 0.16.14.
(visit http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/ for more information)

HOW TO BUILD

  Just run make like,
  $ make

  To clean up, 
  $ make clean

OUTPUT
  
  The two binaries rombios16.bin and VGABIOS-lgpl-latest.cirrus.binare
copied from the directories accordingly, and renamed to bios.bin and
vgabios-cirrus.bin.
