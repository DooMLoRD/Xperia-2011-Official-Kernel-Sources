config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Allow unsafe resume (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.

config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.

config MMC_SD_DETECT_CHATTERING
	bool "Prevent chattering of SD card detection support"
	depends on ARCH_MSM7X30
	default n
	help
	  This increases the duration of retrying the SD card
	  detection in order to reduce the effects by the
	  chattering of SD card detect pin.

config MMC_SD_CHECK_BOOT_SIGNATURE
	bool "Safety for uSD card short circuit"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, uSD driver checks boot signature
	  in MBR when detecting uSD card.If boot signature(0xAA55)
	  is invalid, uSD driver considers it as broken or
	  unformatted card and turns SD_VDD off.This avoids
	  abnormal behavior(e.g over current by short mode) with
	  cracked uSD.
